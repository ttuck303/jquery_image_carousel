# jquery_image_carousel

jquery animate changes css properties
css position the image relative to a fixed window div (left x pixels)
trigger every 5 seconds OR on click of arrow OR on click of little button
use clip property (css) to make sure images are the correct size

need to adjust z index or opacity somehow to make sure that only the active image is showing -> answer is to use overflow: hidden; !!!!


need to create a counter so that once the slides reach the end, they can reset to the starting position
may need to store the images in an array or something to easily loop over them and adjust depending on how many images are in play
